## Intrinsic Innovation Open Source

Welcome to the Intrinsic Innovation Open Source Organization. This organization is set up to host a selection of open source projects from Intrinsic.

This is a small part of our larger open source contributions. We were a [founding member](https://www.intrinsic.ai/blog/posts/supporting-the-open-source-robotics-alliance) of the [Open Source Robotics Alliance](http://osralliance.org) and we actively encourage contributions upstream to open source projects as well as making contributions at all levels of various open source projects that include: 

* ROS ([ros.org](http://ros.org))  
* Gazebo ([gazebosim.org](http://gazebosim.org))  
* Open-RMF ([open-rmf.org](http://open-rmf.org))  
* Google Cloud Robotics ([https://googlecloudrobotics.github.io/core/](https://googlecloudrobotics.github.io/core/))
